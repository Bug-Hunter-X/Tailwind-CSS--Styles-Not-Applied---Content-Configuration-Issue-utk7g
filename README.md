# Tailwind CSS: Content Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied due to an incorrectly configured `content` array in the `tailwind.config.js` file. 

## Problem

The `tailwind.config.js` file is crucial for Tailwind CSS to correctly scan your project for classes and generate the necessary CSS.  If the `content` array is not correctly specified, Tailwind won't find your classes, and your styles will not be applied. 

This example shows how a missing file or an incorrect path in the `content` array will lead to this problem. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully configuring the `content` array to correctly point to all the files containing your Tailwind CSS classes.   This might involve specifying multiple globs to cover different folders within your project.  Ensure that you correctly reflect your project's directory structure.
